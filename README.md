# civ102-bridge-design

Hey Allan, if you are reading this I hope it's going well. The .nb files are mathematica notebooks you can download, manipulate and edit to simulate the experience we had when doing the first step of the project. If you are lazy and do not want to download anything, the .wls files are the raw code that we used and you can read through that. The .pdf files are our CAD drawings that you require us to do. It may also include some rough draft. You can also go through the commits history to see our progression for this project, (you will also get to see our catastrophic mistakes at the begining. Good thing we remembered the third principle of engineering hehehehehehhehehehe :D )
